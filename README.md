# Coffee Shop Sales Management System

This is a **Java-based sales management system** for a coffee shop, developed as a project for the *Programming 3* course. The project focuses on applying object-oriented programming concepts and integrating Java applications with an SQL database to manage product inventory, customer orders, and sales records.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Add, update, and delete coffee shop products.
- **Sales Recording**: Register new sales and associate them with products and quantities.
- **Database Integration**: Store all data in a relational SQL database.
- **Basic GUI (if implemented)** or command-line interaction.
- **Modular Java Code** following OOP principles.

## Technologies Used

- Java SE (Standard Edition)
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
- SQL (MySQL or another relational DBMS)

> Note: You can adapt this to your actual schema.


## Learning Outcomes
- Java-SQL integration using JDBC
- Structured data management with relational databases
- CRUD operations from a Java application
- Strengthening OOP practices in real-world scenarios

## Future Improvements
- Generate reports (e.g., daily sales, top-selling products)
- Input validation and exception handling improvements
